# Algorithms Chat

Let's talk about algorithms!

These assignments are meant to be done in order. In each folder, `main.js` is a
template you need to fill in. Run `npm install` once, then you can use `npm start` to run the tests! When the tests pass, you're done. Have fun!

Check out the branch `answers` to see answers for each assignment.
